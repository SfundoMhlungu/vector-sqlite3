# sqlite-vector

npm package for integrating high-performance vector similarity functions into your SQLite databases. Whether you're building chatbots, recommendation engines, or any app that crunches embeddings, this tool makes vector search fast and easy.

## Why sqlite-vector?

Vector search can be lightning fast when you combine the efficiency of TypedArrays with the power of native C++ code. With **sqlite-vector**, you get:

- **Blazing performance:** Use optimized functions like `cosine_similarity`, `l2_distance`, and `dot_product` directly in SQLite.
- **Flexibility:** Choose native C++ functions via DLL (especially handy on Windows) or stick with pure JavaScript.
- **Easy integration:** Plug it into your existing SQLite projects with minimal fuss.

---

## Installation

Install via npm:

```bash
npm install sqlite-vector
```

> **Note for Windows Users:** The DLL is bundled with the package. For other platforms, feel free to fork the [C plugin code]() and build it for your system.

## Usage

Below is a quick-start guide to get you up and running. This example uses [better-sqlite3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/better-sqlite3) to open a SQLite database and query vector data.

### Example

```js
import Database from 'better-sqlite3';
import sqlitevector from 'sqlitevector';

// Open your database (make sure to use the correct path)
const db = new Database('path/to/your/embedblob.db');

// Activate sqlite-vector with native functions if available
sqlitevector(db, { useNative: ["cosine_similarity", "l2_distance", "dot_product"] });

// If you prefer using the JavaScript implementations (recommended for development/testing):
// sqlitevector(db, { useNative: [] });

// Example: Perform a vector similarity search using cosine similarity
async function runVectorSearch(embedding, sessionId) {
  const rows = db.prepare(`
    SELECT *, cosine_similarity_unrolled(embeddings, ?) AS similarity
    FROM embeddings
    WHERE sessid = ?
  `).all(embedding, sessionId);

  console.log('results:', rows);
}

// Sample embedding as a Float32Array (this would come from your model)
const sampleEmbedding = new Float32Array(modelresults.embeddings.flat()); // expect a 1d typedarray
runVectorSearch(sampleEmbedding, 'sess1');
```

## API

### `sqlitevector(db, options)`

- **db**: Your SQLite database instance (e.g., from [better-sqlite3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/better-sqlite3)).
- **options**: An object with the following property:
  - **useNative**: An array of function names to delegate to the native C++ plugin. For example, `["cosine_similarity", "l2_distance", "dot_product"]`. Set to an empty array (`[]`) to force the use of the JavaScript implementations.

#### Example

```js
sqlitevector(db, { useNative: ["cosine_similarity", "l2_distance"] });
```

---

## Supported Functions

Inside your SQLite queries, you can call the following functions:

- `cosine_similarity`
- `cosine_similarity_unrolled` (an optimized, loop-unrolled version) on pure js only
- `l2_distance`
- `dot_product`

These functions allow you to compute vector similarities and distances directly within your SQL queries, making it easy to build complex vector search features.

## Performance Tips

- **TypedArrays:** this package leverage JavaScriptâ€™s TypedArrays for efficient handling of binary vector data.
- **Native DLL:** On Windows, the bundled DLL uses SIMD optimizations you can use in any language(Go, Php) just copy the dll to the binary folder of your application and load.
- **JavaScript Fallback:** If native functions arenâ€™t available, pure JavaScript implementations offer impressive speed even better than the dll(because of overhead).
